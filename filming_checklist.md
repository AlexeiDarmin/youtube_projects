Process for filming a YouTube video.

Can I even film?

1. 🗓️ Am I available for an uninterrupted half day at least?
2. 🧘 Am I well rested and in the right mindset? 
3. 🍜 Am I well nourished to last half a day?
4. 🚨 Is there an ambient loud noise that I cannot lessen?

Prefilm checklist: 

1. 📝 Prepare content
2. 🧹 Clean filming area of any clutter
3. 👞 Dapper up
4. 💻 Setup physical gear (headset + charged battery, laptop + charger)
5. 💣 Close all personal and work files, clear desktop of all files 
    1. TODO: create a new user for filming, would make the above step obsolete
6. ⚔️ Setup programming tools
    1. VSCode (zoom in for a film friendly font size)
    2. Guest Chrome browser
    3. Initialize `src - <project>/` folder

    1. Open camera recording instance in top right *set stick to top setting*
    2. Open screen and audio recording instance
8. 🔇 Lessen all external sources of noise (close doors, mute devices)
9.  🎥 Calibrate audio, camera, and screen recording as needed
10. 🏃 Practice a handful of short dry-runs, modify content as needed

12. 🎬 Action!

Postfilm checklist: 

1. Import audio, camera, and screen recordings into Lightworks
2. Layer the mediums and sync up audio to video
3. Skim the video and confirm the sync stays consistent throughout
4. Export project as an MP4 (may take a while)
5. Confirm export succesful
   1. [ ] Video and sound quality are high
   2. [ ] The video starts and ends when expected
   3. [ ] Audio and video are synced
6. Upload to Youtube
7. Push code to Github
8. Write up the title, description, and tags as the video uploads
9.  One or two hours after uploading, confirm that 760p or higher versions of the video are available
