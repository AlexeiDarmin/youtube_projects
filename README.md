`npm run start`.

### Videos
- [Building Connect 4 with React Typescript in 70 Minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCgu4F4qlmg)
- [Building TicTacToe with React TypeScript in 35 minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTLq6aWnPFM)


### Disclaimer
I didn't save the code for [Tic-Tac-Toe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTLq6aWnPFM) and [Connect4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCgu4F4qlmg) so I'm rewriting it for historic record, there may be discrepancies from the videos. Moving forward all new videos will match the code in this repo completely.

Let's consider the incomplete investment calculator series a prototype and not include the code here. ðŸ˜…

### Feedback
Please leave feedback regarding the code in the respective videos' comment section - the motivation is for everyone to see the discourse and grow together ðŸ’ª.

For feedback on this readme, or project structure - feel free to open up an issue here (on github).
